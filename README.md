# Neurodynamics-Group5
This repository contains the nonfunctional code we used to try to get the converted SNNs running on SpiNNaker. The main repository with the working code for the ANNs solving differential equations can be found [here](https://github.com/Cl4ryty/Neurodynamics-Group5).
## File structure / remarks
- `run_snn.py` uses the files in `snn_test` – which have been obtained by running the conversion of the ANN trained to solve the test_de with the SNN toolbox – to build a SNN and run a short simulation, print and plot the results – it can be run on spinnaker without specifying further hardware configurations
- `temp/1657821641.3202584/0/ contains the modified SNN toolbox code in `snntoolbox` snd the `loading_test.py` which is supposed to run the conversion of the ANN and simulation of the resulting SNN using the SNN toolbox on spinnaker – however, this required tensorflow and dill to be installed (specified as extra pip installs in the hardware configuration for spinnaker when creating a job) but SpiNNaker does not have sufficient disk space for this
